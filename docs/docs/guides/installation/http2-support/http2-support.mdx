## Why the ZITADEL console needs end-to-end HTTP/2 Support

The ZITADEL console (prefix `/ui/console`) uses [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) for its API calls.
The ZITADEL backend service accepts gRPC-Web requests and translates them into real gRPC calls to itself.
Because ZITADEL accepts gRPC-Web and translates it to gRPC itself, your reverse proxy doesn't need to be able to support gRPC or gRPC-Web.
However, as gRPC requires HTTP/2, your reverse proxy is required to send and receive downstream and upstream HTTP/2 traffic.

## Reverse proxy configuration

<Tabs
    groupId="reverse-proxy"
    default="traefik"
    values={[
        {'label': 'Traefik', 'value': 'traefik'},
    ]}
>
    <TabItem value="traefik">
        <Traefik/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
