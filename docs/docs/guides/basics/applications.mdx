## What is an application?

<!-- An application in ZITADEL describes a part of your project. If your project is built on a micro service arichtecture, then each micro service is an application. -->

Applications are the entry point to your project. Users either login into one of your clients and interact with them directly or use one of your API, maybe without even knowing. All applications share the roles and authorizations of their project.

## Applicaiton types

If you create a new application in ZITADEL Console you have to choose the type of your application. But which one do you have to choose?

Detailed information about authentication types can be found [here](../authentication/login-users#create-application).

  }}

### Web

Server side rendered applications users interact with. For example if you developed an application using Thymeleaf in Java or Razor in .NET or want to enable SSO in Gitlab.

Following authentication types can be used:

- PKCE: is recommended because it's the most secure.
- Code: Use if your application needs client id and client secret.
- (Private Key) JWT: Key file to authorize your application.
- Post: Only use if you have no other possibilities. Client id and client secret in request body.

### Native

Applications installed on a thin client. For example on a smartphone or computer. 

These applications uses the Key file generated by ZITADEL to authenticate.

### User Agent

Applications which are executed in a web browser. For example single page applications executed in the browser developed with JavaScript frameworks like [Angular](../../quickstarts/login/angular) or [React](../../quickstarts/login/react)

Following authentication types can be used:

- PKCE: is recommended because it's the most secure.
- Implicit: Only use if you have no other possibilities. The flow is objective to be removed.

### API

Applications without human interaction, these applications are accessed by other applications, so called machine to machine communication.

Following authentication types can be used:

- (Private Key) JWT: Key file to authorize your application.
- Basic: The application sends username and password

## Redirect URIs

<ThemedImage
  alt="Redirect URIs configuration"
  sources={{

    dark: '/img/guides/redirect-uris-dark.png'
  }}
/>

After the login process ZITADEL sends the user back to its origin.  
ZITADEL verifies if the URL the user gets redirected to is valid by checking if one of the redirect URIs match.

**Redirect URIs** are verified if a user logs in.  
**Post Logout URIs** are verified if the user logs out.

## Create key for private key JWT

After you successfully created your application with authentication type JWT your can create keys in the "KEYS" section of the app details like following video shows:
